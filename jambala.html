<li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
<li>1 onion, diced</li>
<li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
<li>3 stalks celery, diced</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 can diced tomatoes, drained</li>
<li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
