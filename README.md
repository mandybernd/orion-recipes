# orion-recipes

This was my first project as it is part of the curriculum of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">The Odin Project</a>. As someone who grew up with Louisiana cuisine, I decided to create a recipe website featuring dishes from that region using only HTML. The website includes a homepage with a list of recipes and individual recipe pages with ingredients, instructions, and a picture of the finished dish.

Features:
<ol>
<li>Homepage with recipe cards</li>
<li>Individual recipe pages with ingredients, instructions, and a picture</li>
<li>Navigation bar with links to homepage and recipe pages</li></ol>

I had a lot of fun working on this project and I look forward to continuing to develop my web development skills.
