    <h2>The best of Louisiana's taste: Creole cuisine.</h2>
    <p>Louisiana reminds me of my childhood, even though I am a Brazilian citizen. I grew up among Americans most of the time, and the most special people came from Louisiana. <br> Some of those memories are related to Creole cuisine. In summary, Creole cuisine of Louisiana is a blend of French, Spanish, African, and Native American culinary traditions. <br>It is known for its use of flavorful spices, seafood, and rice-based dishes. Some popular dishes in Creole cuisine include gumbo, jambalaya, crawfish étouffée, and red beans and rice.</p>

        <p>Be that as it may, the recipes I will share with you today are in memory of my late uncle Donnie Shaffer, who passed away on this day, April 26th. Rest in peace, Uncle Donnie. 
            <br><p>He was a great cook and shared many delicious recipes with our family, including some traditional Creole dishes. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.</p>
